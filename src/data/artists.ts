            'Working within a wide context, Diane Sophrin\'s works traverse contextual boundaries of place, time and media, developing a personal visual language with which to comment, define and respond to world events and experiential realities. ',
            'Moving from decades of engagement with European traditional two-dimensional techniques and a dedicated figural narrative, her paintings, drawings and prints began a gradual shift towards abstraction and mixed-media that accelerated in 2000 during a first year in Hungary. An idiosyncratic abstract idiom emerged and symbols of personal significance evolved, drawn partly from forms absorbed during earlier years of intense visual scrutiny. ',
            'Process as subject has taken on significant importance in Sophrin\'s work as the construct of series acts as documentation of visual and thematic analysis.The medium itself expresses its own reality, while the work simultaneously presents itself as object(sheaf, scroll, totem, book, box, relic, etc.).The hand and eye add further voice and direction to this exploration.',
            'The dualities of her creative life bring the work to a vital, sharp edge - crossing borders as needed, describing and defining an internal landscape while simultaneously reflecting inescapable external realities. ',
            'Born in Brooklyn, Sophrin is the daughter of a graphic artist and a photographer. Early art studies in NYC museums and public art schools were followed by an undergraduate studio art/humanities major at Binghamton University, independent work at the Boston Museum School and graduate work at the Jan Van Eyck Akademie in the Netherlands.',
            'After completing an MFA in painting and printmaking as a research fellow at Buffalo University, she lectured, edited, curated, mentored, and taught undergraduate and graduate studio art at the Rochester Institute of Technology, the University of Rochester, Alfred University, the University of Tennessee at Knoxville, Vermont College, Norwich University, etc.',
            'Her work was represented by the Nancy Hoffman Gallery in Soho, has been exhibited in galleries and museums in New York City, Vermont, around the US and abroad and is in permanent national and international collections.',
            'Diane has attended many residencies and symposiums at art colonies in central Europe, and received numerous grants in painting and writing including multiple grants from the State Arts Councils of Vermont and New York.',
            'For over two decades she divided her time between Europe and Vermont, working and exhibiting in both places.',
            'While Budapest remains a dwelling place of her soul and a source of aesthetic and intellectual nourishment, there has been a shift of focus over the past several years, resulting in renewed creative connections and fresh discoveries here at home, most recently with exhibitions at the Kent Museum, JLangdon, Studio Place Arts, Stella Quarta Decima Gallery, etc. Her new membership in The Front is a natural expansion of a long, ongoing artistic relationship with Vermont.

I strive to bring emotion, humor and grace into my figures and relish the opportunity to transport the viewer into deeper involvement.',

Clay is a beautifully transformable material that allows greater levels of detail and surface treatment, while plaster gauze keeps me from getting too fussy. It\'s immediate and encourages a lack control. The two materials work together in me, fostering new ways to think and work, each informing the other.',

        //     "Hasso Ewing started her professional career as a graphic designer/illustrator, illustrating children's books, building exhibits for children's museums, drawing and building camera-ready 'mechanicals' with an exacto blade and hot wax- until the computer came on the scene. She gave up all that wonderful handwork for a keyboard and screen. After more than 10 years designing on a monitor, Hasso had had her fill of computer generated artwork. She wanted to get outside, work three dimensionally and help restore our damaged land. Using her creative skills, Hasso started a design firm specializing in recreating naturalistic landscapes and connecting people with nature. She worked with both public and private land owners generating all her plans with pen and pencil on paper. The seasonal aspect of landscape work gave Hasso some time to play with the finer arts of oil painting, pastels and charcoal large scale drawings but, most satisfyingly, clay.",
        //     "Hasso is once again reorienting her creative vision by devoting herself to learning the craft of sculpture. Currently, she is building boxes, thick, heavy mugs and exploring the human figure thru clay. It's all about observing and studying what happens when hands meet clay and how that expands her creative process."

            "I grew up in Eastern Kentucky and have lived in Montpelier, VT for the last 10 years. Most of my painting experience over the years has been exploring color relationships and developing my own vocabulary of form, using sketches as a starting point. More recently, I have found more of my voice in terms of subject matter as well. For example, I spent over a year thinking about our interactions with cell phones, making paintings and drawings, which culminated in a show called #nomophobia.",
            "My work comes alive through juxtaposition; it's about the interplay of forces on a flat surface. The search for beauty and variation within that premise is what keeps me painting. Inside the four walls of the rectangle, lines, colors, and shapes all interact with one another to create a whole. For me, the intrigue of each of my works stems from the harmony, conflict, or interplay of each of these elements. ",
            "I relish each step of the painting process. Getting started is an exciting prospect. I choose a composition, translate it to a larger surface, and quickly block it in color. The slower portion then takes hold. From the beginning, each new mark is a response to the set of marks already present. A bold, nearly-neon, pink sky might require a light and bright blue for the water, which then means the pattern of triangles in the foreground needs to become stronger to hold it all together. Each force in the work is there for the beauty of itself and also to keep the balance with every other force in a sort of equilibrium."

Her work is influenced by the light and seasons of three river valleys---the Rio Grande, the Sacramento, and the Winooski. Kate\'s interest is in the interactive nature of being-and-seeing connected to time and place. Her congenital visual impairment brings with it a sensitivity to the creative and quixotic nature of seeing. The Japanese aesthetic of wabi-sabi with its emphasis on imperfection and the fleeting, bittersweet nature of life is a guiding principle in Kate\'s work.',

Her writing has appeared in numerous journals, including <em>North American Review</em>, <em>Nimrod</em>, and <em>Hunger Mountain</em>.  Kate\'s received numerous Pushcart nominations, as well as grants from Vermont Council on the Arts and residencies at Vermont Studio Center for both poetry and visual art. ',

There is an element of community among the trees. ",

Marjorie lived in NYC for 20 years where she earned a BFA at The Cooper Union and studied with Mercedes Matter and Charles Cajori, at the NY Studio School both wonderful,(but she still resisted everything she was told ). She was a founding student there.The friends she made were perhaps the best part ~that and the museum and gallery shows. The Redstockings Women's Movement and organizing open women artist shows influenced her politics. The country life beckoned, the rents skyrocketed, her little family arrived in Vermont in the 80's for keeps. She paints recognizable images in a natural style that is hopefully neither conservative nor gimmicky but sincere. Direct experience.",

It occurred to me that since the forest/network is often considered a landscape, digital and technological networks might be considered a landscape as well. I decided to try to see these landscapes as one. In 2018 I managed to learn enough Python to tinker with source code for a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) which I found on Github, and have been exploring this avenue ever since. GAN generated images, using training sets assembled from my own work and photos, have been the basis for much of my work since then.',
            'Coincidental with the recent emergence of text to image generators such as DALL-E (also GAN based) I have become focused less on image generation, and more on sequencing images and the possibilities for narration, code, and multidimensional structures. The large image generators such as DALL-E translate complete words into complete pictures. I am interested in interactions with \'the machine\' at a more cellular level.',

            // "Before moving to Vermont, I was interested in technology in the landscape, and networks generally. Smokestacks by highways were one preoccupation. Now I live surrounded by forest, and have come to see a connection between the forest network and the human/non-human/digital network. This has been the subject, or starting point of my most recent explorations.",
