She gave up all that wonderful handwork for a keyboard and screen. After more than 10 years designing on a monitor, Hasso had had her fill of computer generated artwork. She wanted to get outside, work three dimensionally and help restore our damaged land. Using her creative skills, Hasso started a design firm specializing in recreating naturalistic landscapes and connecting people with nature. She worked with both public and private land owners generating all her plans with pen and pencil on paper. The seasonal aspect of landscape work gave Hasso some time to play with the finer arts of oil painting, pastels and charcoal large scale drawings but, most satisfyingly, clay.",
            "Hasso is once again reorienting her creative vision by devoting herself to learning the craft of sculpture. Currently, she is building boxes, thick, heavy mugs and exploring the human figure thru clay. It's all about observing and studying what happens when hands meet clay and how that expands her creative process."

There is an element of community among the trees. ",

Marjorie lived in NYC for 20 years where she earned a BFA at The Cooper Union and studied with Mercedes Matter and Charles Cajori, at the NY Studio School both wonderful,(but she still resisted everything she was told ). She was a founding student there.The friends she made were perhaps the best part ~that and the museum and gallery shows. The Redstockings Women's Movement and organizing open women artist shows influenced her politics. The country life beckoned, the rents skyrocketed, her little family arrived in Vermont in the 80's for keeps. She paints recognizable images in a natural style that is hopefully neither conservative nor gimmicky but sincere. Direct experience.",
