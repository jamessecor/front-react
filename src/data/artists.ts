            'Moving from decades of engagement with European traditional two-dimensional techniques and a dedicated figural narrative, her paintings, drawings and prints began a gradual shift towards abstraction and mixed-media that accelerated in 2000 during a first year in Hungary. An idiosyncratic abstract idiom emerged and symbols of personal significance evolved, drawn partly from forms absorbed during earlier years of intense visual scrutiny. ',
            'Process as subject has taken on significant importance in Sophrin\'s work as the construct of series acts as documentation of visual and thematic analysis.The medium itself expresses its own reality, while the work simultaneously presents itself as object(sheaf, scroll, totem, book, box, relic, etc.).The hand and eye add further voice and direction to this exploration.',

            'Born in Brooklyn, Sophrin is the daughter of a graphic artist and a photographer. Early art studies in NYC museums and public art schools were followed by an undergraduate studio art/humanities major at Binghamton University, independent work at the Boston Museum School and graduate work at the Jan Van Eyck Akademie in the Netherlands.',
            'After completing an MFA in painting and printmaking as a research fellow at Buffalo University, she lectured, edited, curated, mentored, and taught undergraduate and graduate studio art at the Rochester Institute of Technology, the University of Rochester, Alfred University, the University of Tennessee at Knoxville, Vermont College, Norwich University, etc.',

She gave up all that wonderful handwork for a keyboard and screen. After more than 10 years designing on a monitor, Hasso had had her fill of computer generated artwork. She wanted to get outside, work three dimensionally and help restore our damaged land. Using her creative skills, Hasso started a design firm specializing in recreating naturalistic landscapes and connecting people with nature. She worked with both public and private land owners generating all her plans with pen and pencil on paper. The seasonal aspect of landscape work gave Hasso some time to play with the finer arts of oil painting, pastels and charcoal large scale drawings but, most satisfyingly, clay.",
            "Hasso is once again reorienting her creative vision by devoting herself to learning the craft of sculpture. Currently, she is building boxes, thick, heavy mugs and exploring the human figure thru clay. It's all about observing and studying what happens when hands meet clay and how that expands her creative process."

            "I grew up in Eastern Kentucky and have lived in Montpelier, VT for the last 10 years. Most of my painting experience over the years has been exploring color relationships and developing my own vocabulary of form, using sketches as a starting point. More recently, I have found more of my voice in terms of subject matter as well. For example, I spent over a year thinking about our interactions with cell phones, making paintings and drawings, which culminated in a show called #nomophobia.",
            "My work comes alive through juxtaposition; it's about the interplay of forces on a flat surface. The search for beauty and variation within that premise is what keeps me painting. Inside the four walls of the rectangle, lines, colors, and shapes all interact with one another to create a whole. For me, the intrigue of each of my works stems from the harmony, conflict, or interplay of each of these elements. ",
            "I relish each step of the painting process. Getting started is an exciting prospect. I choose a composition, translate it to a larger surface, and quickly block it in color. The slower portion then takes hold. From the beginning, each new mark is a response to the set of marks already present. A bold, nearly-neon, pink sky might require a light and bright blue for the water, which then means the pattern of triangles in the foreground needs to become stronger to hold it all together. Each force in the work is there for the beauty of itself and also to keep the balance with every other force in a sort of equilibrium."

There is an element of community among the trees. ",

Marjorie lived in NYC for 20 years where she earned a BFA at The Cooper Union and studied with Mercedes Matter and Charles Cajori, at the NY Studio School both wonderful,(but she still resisted everything she was told ). She was a founding student there.The friends she made were perhaps the best part ~that and the museum and gallery shows. The Redstockings Women's Movement and organizing open women artist shows influenced her politics. The country life beckoned, the rents skyrocketed, her little family arrived in Vermont in the 80's for keeps. She paints recognizable images in a natural style that is hopefully neither conservative nor gimmicky but sincere. Direct experience.",
