She gave up all that wonderful handwork for a keyboard and screen. After more than 10 years designing on a monitor, Hasso had had her fill of computer generated artwork. She wanted to get outside, work three dimensionally and help restore our damaged land. Using her creative skills, Hasso started a design firm specializing in recreating naturalistic landscapes and connecting people with nature. She worked with both public and private land owners generating all her plans with pen and pencil on paper. The seasonal aspect of landscape work gave Hasso some time to play with the finer arts of oil painting, pastels and charcoal large scale drawings but, most satisfyingly, clay.",

Currently, she is building boxes, thick, heavy mugs and exploring the human figure thru clay.

Most of my painting experience over the years has been exploring color relationships and developing my own vocabulary of form, using sketches as a starting point. More recently, I have found more of my voice in terms of subject matter as well. For example, I spent over a year thinking about our interactions with cell phones, making paintings and drawings, which culminated in a show called #nomophobia.",
            "My work comes alive through juxtaposition; it's about the interplay of forces on a flat surface. The search for beauty and variation within that premise is what keeps me painting. Inside the four walls of the rectangle, lines, colors, and shapes all interact with one another to create a whole. For me, the intrigue of each of my works stems from the harmony, conflict, or interplay of each of these elements. ",
            "I relish each step of the painting process. Getting started is an exciting prospect. I choose a composition, translate it to a larger surface, and quickly block it in color. The slower portion then takes hold. From the beginning, each new mark is a response to the set of marks already present. A bold, nearly-neon, pink sky might require a light and bright blue for the water, which then means the pattern of triangles in the foreground needs to become stronger to hold it all together. Each force in the work is there for the beauty of itself and also to keep the balance with every other force in a sort of equilibrium."

She was a founding student there.The friends she made were perhaps the best part ~that and the museum and gallery shows. The Redstockings Women's Movement and organizing open women artist shows influenced her politics. The country life beckoned, the rents skyrocketed, her little family arrived in Vermont in the 80's for keeps.

In addition to participating in the Montpelier Art's Walk many times, in 2020 she was one of 60+ Vermont artists who created work specially for The Sheltering In Place Project curated by Hasso Ewing and hosted by the Highland Center For The Arts.",

            'BA in Creative Writing Residential College, University of Michigan circa 1982; Studied at Art Students League, NYC (1991) and various continuing education programs for drawing and painting techniques since then. Self taught: Image Magick and Photoshop digital image creation and manipulation, open source shell scripting. Online courses in Python and Creative Applications of Deep Learning (2018).',
            'My work is not in any one tradition. Influences range from the conceptual art of Lawrence Weiner and poems and objects of Carl Andre to the comic art of George Herriman, cellular automata, and beyond. In Boston around 2000 I learned the Mische oil and egg tempera painting technique which led to a brief foray into miniature landscape painting. The US invasion of Iraq shifted my focus to text based drawings as well as digital and video explorations. I used open source image software (GIMP) until some illustration work pushed me inevitably into Photoshop.',
            'An early background in stage carpentry and lighting led to my strong connection with the work of Samuel Beckett.  Beckett is an ongoing influence and informs the name lightblack, an LLC I created initially for video and film co-productions with the late Michael H. Shamberg, which is now a container for my own efforts. lightblack ceased being an active production company with Michael\'s illness though we continued to collaborate as his health allowed, up until the time of his death in 2014. During that time I was very involved in his care.',
            'I moved to Vermont with my family in 2013, and we live surrounded by forest. Around 2017 I began to see the forest as a network, an idea borne out by subsequent reading. It occurred to me that since the forest/network is often considered a landscape, digital and technological networks might be considered a landscape as well. I decided to try to see these landscapes as one. In 2018 I managed to learn enough Python to tinker with source code for a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) which I found on Github, and have been exploring this avenue ever since. GAN generated images, using training sets assembled from my own work and photos, have been the basis for much of my work since then.',
            'Coincidental with the recent emergence of text to image generators such as DALL-E (also GAN based) I have become focused less on image generation, and more on sequencing images and the possibilities for narration, code, and multidimensional structures. The large image generators such as DALL-E translate complete words into complete pictures. I am interested in interactions with \'the machine\' at a more cellular level.',
