Bob Hannan, her partner of almost 50 years, has created a unique soundtrack to complement the show with photographs featuring her work.',
            'Over the past two years Ewing has been exploring new materials and following her intuition to develop a series of work inspired by the themes of natural design, place and belonging. As a collector of natural objects Ewing has made an assemblage of detailed specimens of pods, shells and seeds in clay.  She has also pursued an interest in cordage, weaving and fiber. With this new interest she will be showing a large scale looped sculpture made with fishing line, as well as baskets of cloth, paper, dried seaweed and spruce root.  A recent development in her work has been a trio of hand painted clay sculptures honoring our female ancestors and their stewardship of the intrinsic powers of plants and animals.',
            'There will be an opportunity to watch and speak with Ewing, who will be creating a looping project in a front window of the gallery (dates to be determined). During her artist\'s talk she will be teaching interested attendees how to make cordage with wild collected materials, while sharing her new artistic passions and process.',

This event, the 67th group exhibit presented by the gallery, expresses the members\' gratitude and joy in making it through 10 interesting years in Montpelier.',
            'The Front is a member-owned, cooperatively managed business founded in the spring of 2015. More than 50 artist members over the years have provided funds, artwork, and labor to keep the space active and vibrant. Community members, visitors, and collectors have all contributed.',
            'For its first 5 years, The Front focused entirely on group shows, presenting 8 shows each year on average. In 2020, members increased the tempo to 12 shows per year and began alternating between all-member group shows and single-person solo shows. The gallery\'s first solo show featured work by the late, much-admired painter Ray Brown, opening in March 2020 only to be shuttered by the COVID-19 pandemic. Since then, the gallery has persisted, with a total of 67 group shows and 30 solo shows so far.',
            'To celebrate the 10th anniversary, the current 23 member-owners of The Front have invited all 36 former members to submit one piece of artwork each for a joyfully crowded, vibrant display of creativity and cooperative energy. The gallery will host events throughout the month (dates TBA) to highlight the exhibit, including poetry, music, discussion and more.'

            'In this collection of recent work, Richardson extends his exploration of the connection between natural and digital landscapes to consider the connection between human and machine learning, memory and perception.',
            '‘new memory’ refers to the process of adding physical memory to a computer, as well as invitations to nostalgia from the AI agents on our phones (“You have a new memory!”), and ultimately the idea that one might build new memory through new perception.',
            'After working for several years generating images via Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) trained on his own landscape work, Richardson now incorporates these images into constructions where they are sometimes the central element, and sometimes barely visible. These constructions vary considerably but can be roughly categorized as mostly landscape, mostly ghost, or mostly machine.',
            'The ghosts are multiple - traces of humanity, relics of history, and a possible consciousness growing in ‘the machine.’',
            'The machine models are constructions that look back on the ghosts (or the ghost landscape) through disassembled laptop and tablet screens with elements of slide rules and logarithmic scales built into them.  The most direct view of these ghosts may be through a series of layered transparent stereograms, for which there will be a viewer available.',
            'Richardson has been a member of the Front since 2018. He exhibits locally and also at Galerie Arnaud Lefebvre in Paris.',
            'Richardson received a BA in Creative Writing from the University of Michigan in 1982. Aside from a semester at the Art Students League in New York, he is ‘self taught’.'

            'So which is it, Glen, solo show or group show? That, indeed, is the question raised by the  exhibit at The Front in Montpelier. Hutcheson is the founding member of the artist-owned  cooperative gallery. This is his solo show, but it includes work he prompted in collaboration  with other member artists, swapping panels back and forth. Solo or group, the exhibit is an  exploration of the artistic self.',
            'Roughly half of the show is work by Hutcheson, in a multitude of media—paintings,  sculptures, assemblages. That’s the solo show.  ',
            'The other half is work he created with other member artists of the collaborative. He proposed  the process a year ago—pairs of artists would work on two panels simultaneously, swapping  them back and forth once a month. The results—that’s the group show.',
            'The exhibit includes canvases, reconfigured household objects, and used clothing.  Hutcheson’s choices are experimental, uncertain, rough, tentative. “What I love in the  collaborative stuff is when I don’t recognize my work or my colleague’s work,” he says. “Where  did this come from?” He describes this collaborative process as “the most reliable means I’ve  found toward creating something that I don’t recognize as coming from me—and yet is  beautiful and satisfying.”',
            'The juxtaposition of the solo work and the collaborative work blurs the line between individual  and community and raises interesting questions of authorship and identity. In a philosophical  mood, Hutcheson reflects on the Buddhist idea of no-self. Looking at his own work—“so  scattered, so many media and ideas, all chaotic, no coherence,” he laments, laughing at  himself. “So what is the self anyway?”',
            'Hutcheson is well known in many roles in Montpelier, from the Drawing Board to City Hall.',
            'He has a Fine Arts degree in painting from Haverford College, where he studied with Ying Li,  and he has an MFA in sculpture from the New York Studio School (2009), where he studied  with Bruce Gagnier and Garth Evans.',

            'The tall dark panels contrast with light and color in other pieces made along her journey: painted collages with bright leaves of paper, enigmatic small boxes, fold-out books and antique books that have been remade as artist\'s sketchbooks.  Some pieces reflect a dialog with József Attila, a 20th century Hungarian poet. The contrast of light and dark suggests movement on the continuum between chaos and catharsis.',
            'Sophrin\'s materials are simple and reused. Nothing is cut; everything is torn. She has come to favor a backing of paper bags, carefully unfolded, joined and gessoed. The stitched pieces imply the temporal nature of a whole created from many parts. Visually, the figural form stands stark against the light background, a mute testimony to the 21st century. Sophrin\'s work reflects fragmentation and reassemblage; her use of collage is allegorical. It is an act of remembrance and saving; repairing the world.',
            'The daughter of a graphic artist and a photographer, Sophrin\'s early art studies in NYC were followed by undergraduate and graduate work in the US and Europe. After an MFA fellowship she lectured, curated, and taught studio art for more than twenty years. She has been awarded multiple grants in painting and writing from the State Arts Councils of Vermont and New York. Her work can be found in many public and private European collections. The autumn of 2023 she returned to Budapest with a residency at the Budapest 9th District Historical Museum and a solo show at the Open Workshop Art Center. She is an active and long-standing member of both the Society of Hungarian Painters and the Front Gallery here in Vermont.'

            'Melora Kennedy\'s November show at The Front in Montpelier covers a vast range—the Human Family—but in familiar terrain:  back yards, streets and houses, apples and petunias. Her bright and free paintings of landscapes and people are mixed with occasional sculptural constructions of found objects,',
            'Each of her works has its original title, but Kennedy has matched each with a phrase or idea from the 1948 UN Declaration of Human Rights—a kind of found poetry that gives the show a wholly unexpected unity and force in the current cultural context. For example: Joe Pie Weed and Onions:  “Right to Marry.”  Glass Table: “Privacy of Family, Home, and Correspondence.” I Went to the River: “Life, Liberty, and Security of Person.”',
            'In a corner of the gallery one may listen to a recording of different voices and nationalities reading passages from the Declaration of Human Rights, set to music by Max Richter.',
            'Kennedy describes her experience of creating as a quiet thrill,“like having a fish on the line.” It\'s an experience to be shared—and worth getting hooked.'

            'There are two sides to Anne Cogbill Rose\'s paintings during the era of Covid 19: the fragile but critical fabric of family, friends, and love; and the persistent intrusions of external fear, anger, and loss.',
            'Rose does not shy away from the extremes. The same intensity and intimacy are found in a portrait of a grand-daughter, achingly sweet, and a heart-stopping tableau of George Floyd’s killing. Both are rendered with the same artistic vocabulary of large fields of color and simple figurative shapes. The paintings themselves—and one mobile —are too large and strong to walk by casually.',
            'It takes courage to mount a show like this. “I\'m feeling vulnerable,” Rose says. But her openness to both love and fear may allow the viewer as well to open up to the beauty and pain of our times.',
            'Rose is married to the painter Jonathan Rose. “We both paint,” she says, “but we try not to comment on each other’s work unless asked.” (Both smile.) They have kept at it for nearly 60 years. For 20 years they ran a B and B in the West Indies, leading art retreats and classes. Today they live in Thetford, Vermont and winter in Merida, Mexico, on the Yucatan peninsula.'

            '“Various” is the word for Sam Thurston’s solo show at The Front in July: carved basswood heads and figures, painted still lifes, small ceramics, even his long fascination with architectural detail. Half of the work is from the last three years, and the rest recalls earlier years beginning in a small NYC apartment, “having quit art school.”',
            '“This show could be called an older person bringing their past into focus while still concentrating on the present,” Sam says. “I’m 81 now,” he adds. The work represents the range and diversity of experience in a life well-lived in the arts, back and forth from 14th Street in NYC to a farmhouse in Lowell VT, with his wife, the painter Marjorie Kramer.',
            'The bold sculpted heads, his current work, are approximately life-size but feel larger than life, with a still formality that feels as much like a totem as a portrait. Details reveal Sam’s wit: a hair clasp on the back of a head becomes a garden spade; a scar in the wood of another head becomes a featured birth mark.',
            'Earlier works in two dimensions or in bas relief have a related stillness. Even the figures on a city corner (or in a rocking boat) have the same formality and composure. For the artist, this appears to be life-long.'

            'Bottinelli grew up in New England during the 40s and 50s in a rural neighborhood surrounded by woods, a pond, and a salt water river. As a child, she played outdoors in all seasons, collected stamps, and cut images from the Sears & Roebuck catalog to make domestic dioramas.',
            'In the mid-80s, she made the decision to return to college. Feeling at home in the art department, she says it was there she "decided she could be an artist," drawing upon the things she loved as a child - collecting, scissors, and nature.',
            'In the 90s, at the Vermont Studio Center, Bottinelli discovered encaustics (beeswax, resin, pigment) and began using this medium for her collage work. At the same time, she was collecting Maine driftwood each summer, "not always clear what I would do with them." Eventually the beeswax melded into the wood work. Principles that guide her process are "drawing on iconic memories, enough of nothing, serenity amid chaos."',
            'For more than three decades Bottinelli has become known for her collage paintings and found-wood assemblages. Her work has been shown in Maine, from the Leighton gallery in Blue Hill, and the Elan Gallery in Rockport; to Studio Place Arts in Barre, the Kent Museum in Calais, and university shows at Norwich University, Goddard College, and Castleton and Johnson State Colleges. She lives and works in Hardwick, Vermont.'

            'Elisabeth Mazzilli is a fabric artist working in the painstaking tradition of hooking. Her solo exhibit at The Front in January consists mainly of large hooked images of animals and personal symbols that constitute a Tarot -- a set of images, originally on playing cards, used for divination or gaining insight into past, present, and future.',
            'Her imagery comes out of a life off the grid. "I live very close to the land," she says, "and over the last 20 years I have developed a strong personal companionship with the forest and animals I live with." She collaborated with her son, also an artist, on the original design, and completed the hooking over the last winter.',
            'In the past she has developed annual series on themes including depression, immigration, the Me Too movement, and the mountains she loves. Her Tarot images represent the passage of every stage of life in the cycles of death and rebirth.'

The show offers a view into tentative ideas becoming clarified over time.',

Her work in both clay and paint has received far-ranging attention and praise. Some of her clay whistles are in major collections, and her paintings were exhibited this summer in solo shows at the Highland Arts Center in Greensboro, The Gallery in the Woods in Brattleboro, and at the Central Vermont Medical Center.'

            'For most of her life, Marjorie Kramer has been a Vermonter, but her artistic career began in New York City in the 60s and 70s. She has a BFA from Cooper Union Art School, where she met her husband, the sculptor and painter Samuel Thurston. For more than a decade they lived and worked in New York but spent their summers at their home in Lowell, Vermont.',
            'Today, sitting in the old farmhouse up high in Lowell, Marjorie looks more like a Vermont painter spending time in New York when possible. Many of the portraits in her show at The Front reflect her history of advocacy for women painters and cooperative galleries. (Her favorite show was the First Open Show of Feminist Art at MUSEUM in 1971—“free, non-curated, fabulous!”) The landscapes in her show at The Front are pure Vermont.',
            'Marjorie was a student founder of the New York Studio School of Drawing, Painting, and Sculpture. She has a very long list of solo and group shows from New York City through New England and beyond and has taught students at Johnson State University and Vermont Community College as well as art programs in small Vermont elementary schools. Her work has been called “plucky and lyrical,” with a “delicate sense of touch,” and “remarkable neomodernist observational rigor.”',
            'Painting, teaching, organizing; summers in Vermont, building a house, having a child. “It was all great fun,” she says. “I painted most days through all this.”'

After completing an MFA in painting and printmaking as a research fellow at Buffalo University, she lectured, curated and taught studio art at the Rochester Institute of Technology, the University of Rochester, Alfred University, the University of Tennessee at Knoxville, Vermont College, Union Institute, and Norwich University.',

Having exhibited and attended art residencies in Central Europe for nearly two decades, her work can be found in many public and private European collections. The autumn of 2023 saw a return to Budapest with her solo exhibition/residency at the Budapest 9th District Historical Museum and a solo show at the Open Workshop Art Center. She is an active and long-standing member of the Society of Hungarian Painters.',

            'Stowe artist Chip Haggerty sends really big thank you notes. His series of “Thank You Notes” is being shown through the month of May at The Front in Montpelier. The notes, often six feet long or tall, are exuberantly painted and scrawled on brown bag paper.',
            'The series began with a note to a relative “to thank her for putting us up and putting up with us.” That first note, full of color and wit, also began his career as a painter.',
            'Haggerty grew up on Long Island and went to school in New England, which led him to Stowe, where he has lived for the past 45 years. “I have mostly waited on tables,” Haggerty says, "but did do a short stint preparing meals for Maria Von Trapp and her companion, as well as making granola at the health food store."'

            'Northern Vermont has been her base, her foundation, for fifty years as Elizabeth Nelson explores the colder climate and landscapes of Vermont, Iceland and Norway in her paintings. The paintings are comments on the beauty and fragility of these harsh environments in this time of climate and environmental change. Storms, immense peace and sometimes unearthly beauty are expressed in a call to protect the fragile balance of our lives with the changing earth.',
            'Elizabeth Nelson began painting when she was eight. She graduated from Rhode Island School of Design and then lived in Guatemala for a year. She received a Master\'s degree at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, and she has lived in northern Vermont for over fifty years where she raised her children. She has been a teacher, dairy farmer, museum curator and always a painter.',
            'She has exhibited throughout Vermont and New England as well as in juried shows in Reykjavik, Iceland, Wisconsin, Oregon, New York, Kentucky and Pennsylvania. Her work was featured prominently in the “Art of Vermont” exhibit which toured state-wide. As part of a three person show, Burlington City Arts exhibited her work and she was also in two “Of Land and Local” exhibits at BCA which included a residency in Elmore State Park, VT. She has had two solo shows at the Vermont Supreme Court. Her work is in many private collections and in the Vermont State Art Collection. Four paintings are a permanent installation of public art at the State Police Barracks in Derby VT and four paintings are also installed at the Royalton Department of Public Safety, She was a resident at the Vermont Artist Week at The Vermont Studio Center in Johnson VT, and a resident for a month each in 2017 and 2018 at the SÍM (Association of Icelandic Artists) in Reykjavik Iceland.',
            'The show opens 4-7pm, Friday March 3. The Front is open Fridays 4-7, weekends 11-5, and by appointment. There will also be an artist\'s talk in the gallery Thursday March 16, 5-6 PM.'

The book includes short rhyming phrases about various animals in all sorts of places. The illustrations match the whimsy of the verses in their playfulness with color and composition. The text is typed directly onto the 3”x3” squares, on which delicate, colorful scenes are painted in gouache.',
            'The second portion of this show, Freedom Fries, features references to fast food, religion, consumption, energy production, and lots of American flags, as can be seen in just about any American landscape. In contrast to Creature Habits, the theme of these paintings is harder to nail down. Some seem to be critiques of nationalism (and the exceptionalist mindset that may go with it), while others focus more on climate justice. If the themes are a little everywhere in this series, what pulls the paintings together is the joy with which they are painted, the play of color and texture, as is typical in James\'s work.'
