She has shown her visual art throughout New Hampshire and Vermont and has received grants in both poetry and visual art from the Vermont Studio Center and the Vermont Council on the Arts.

            'Bottinelli grew up in New England during the 40s and 50s in a rural neighborhood surrounded by woods, a pond, and a salt water river. As a child, she played outdoors in all seasons, collected stamps, and cut images from the Sears & Roebuck catalog to make domestic dioramas.',
            'In the mid-80s, she made the decision to return to college. Feeling at home in the art department, she says it was there she "decided she could be an artist," drawing upon the things she loved as a child - collecting, scissors, and nature.',
            'In the 90s, at the Vermont Studio Center, Bottinelli discovered encaustics (beeswax, resin, pigment) and began using this medium for her collage work. At the same time, she was collecting Maine driftwood each summer, "not always clear what I would do with them." Eventually the beeswax melded into the wood work. Principles that guide her process are "drawing on iconic memories, enough of nothing, serenity amid chaos."',
            'For more than three decades Bottinelli has become known for her collage paintings and found-wood assemblages. Her work has been shown in Maine, from the Leighton gallery in Blue Hill, and the Elan Gallery in Rockport; to Studio Place Arts in Barre, the Kent Museum in Calais, and university shows at Norwich University, Goddard College, and Castleton and Johnson State Colleges. She lives and works in Hardwick, Vermont.'

            'Elisabeth Mazzilli is a fabric artist working in the painstaking tradition of hooking. Her solo exhibit at The Front in January consists mainly of large hooked images of animals and personal symbols that constitute a Tarot -- a set of images, originally on playing cards, used for divination or gaining insight into past, present, and future.',
            'Her imagery comes out of a life off the grid. "I live very close to the land," she says, "and over the last 20 years I have developed a strong personal companionship with the forest and animals I live with." She collaborated with her son, also an artist, on the original design, and completed the hooking over the last winter.',
            'In the past she has developed annual series on themes including depression, immigration, the Me Too movement, and the mountains she loves. Her Tarot images represent the passage of every stage of life in the cycles of death and rebirth.'

She has a BFA from Cooper Union Art School, where she met her husband, the sculptor and painter Samuel Thurston. For more than a decade they lived and worked in New York but spent their summers at their home in Lowell, Vermont.',
            'Today, sitting in the old farmhouse up high in Lowell, Marjorie looks more like a Vermont painter spending time in New York when possible. Many of the portraits in her show at The Front reflect her history of advocacy for women painters and cooperative galleries. (Her favorite show was the First Open Show of Feminist Art at MUSEUM in 1971—“free, non-curated, fabulous!”) The landscapes in her show at The Front are pure Vermont.',
            'Marjorie was a student founder of the New York Studio School of Drawing, Painting, and Sculpture. She has a very long list of solo and group shows from New York City through New England and beyond and has taught students at Johnson State University and Vermont Community College as well as art programs in small Vermont elementary schools. Her work has been called “plucky and lyrical,” with a “delicate sense of touch,” and “remarkable neomodernist observational rigor.”',
            'Painting, teaching, organizing; summers in Vermont, building a house, having a child. “It was all great fun,” she says. “I painted most days through all this.”'

Her recent abstract mixed-media works on prepared papers are often stained, stitched and layered, sometimes presenting as movable assemblages, often exploring elements of collage or text, frequently double-sided!',
            'The daughter of a graphic artist and a photographer, Sophrin&#39;s early art studies in New York City  were followed by a studio art/humanities major at Binghamton University, intensive studies in traditional techniques at the Boston Museum School and independent graduate work at the Jan Van Eyck Akademie in the Netherlands. After completing an MFA in painting and printmaking as a research fellow at Buffalo University, she lectured, curated and taught studio art at the Rochester Institute of Technology, the University of Rochester, Alfred University, the University of Tennessee at Knoxville, Vermont College, Union Institute, and Norwich University.',
            'Sophrin divides her time between Europe and Vermont. Having exhibited and attended art residencies in Central Europe for nearly two decades, her work can be found in many public and private European collections. The autumn of 2023 saw a return to Budapest with her solo exhibition/residency at the Budapest 9th District Historical Museum and a solo show at the Open Workshop Art Center. She is an active and long-standing member of the Society of Hungarian Painters.',
            'Over the decades Sophrin&#39;s work has been shown in galleries and museums in New York, Massachusetts, Vermont and around the US, and can be found in permanent national collections. These venues include the Nancy Hoffman Gallery and the National Academy of Design in New York City; the Williams College Museum of Art and the Bromfield Gallery in Massachusetts; the Albright Knox Gallery Art Museum, the Memorial Art Gallery and the Hudson River Museum in New York State, the San Francisco Museum of Art, the Art Institute of Chicago. She was awarded multiple grants in painting and writing from the State Arts Councils of Vermont and New York.',
            'Diane is currently an artist member of the Front Gallery in Montpelier, participating in the cooperative gallery&#39;s bimonthly group shows. She has had solo exhibits in Vermont at the Helen Day Art Center, the Wood Gallery and Arts Center, Lyndon State College, St. Michael&#39;s College, Norwich University, Southern Vermont College, as well as Studio Place Arts, and J.Langdon. Her work has been featured in group exhibitions at the Kent Museum, the Brattleboro Museum, the Stella Quarta Decima Gallery, and other galleries around the state.'

She has been a teacher, dairy farmer, museum curator and always a painter.',

She has had two solo shows at the Vermont Supreme Court. Her work is in many private collections and in the Vermont State Art Collection. Four paintings are a permanent installation of public art at the State Police Barracks in Derby VT and four paintings are also installed at the Royalton Department of Public Safety, She was a resident at the Vermont Artist Week at The Vermont Studio Center in Johnson VT, and a resident for a month each in 2017 and 2018 at the SÍM (Association of Icelandic Artists) in Reykjavik Iceland.',

The text is typed directly onto the 3”x3” squares, on which delicate, colorful scenes are painted in gouache.',

In contrast to Creature Habits, the theme of these paintings is harder to nail down. Some seem to be critiques of nationalism (and the exceptionalist mindset that may go with it), while others focus more on climate justice. If the themes are a little everywhere in this series, what pulls the paintings together is the joy with which they are painted, the play of color and texture, as is typical in James\'s work.'
